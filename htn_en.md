## An Introductory Contradiction

Anyone who watches the busy, tremendously productive world of Internet
open-source software for a while is bound to notice an interesting
contradiction between what open-source hackers say they believe and the way
they actually behaveâ€”between the official ideology of the open-source culture
and its actual practice.

Cultures are adaptive machines. The open-source culture is a response to an
identifiable set of drives and pressures. As usual, the culture's adaptation
to its circumstances manifests both as conscious ideology and as implicit,
unconscious or semi-conscious knowledge. And, as is not uncommon, the
unconscious adaptations are partly at odds with the conscious ideology.

In this essay, I will dig around the roots of that contradiction, and use it
to discover those drives and pressures. I will deduce some interesting things
about the hacker culture and its customs. I will conclude by suggesting ways
in which the culture's implicit knowledge can be leveraged better.
